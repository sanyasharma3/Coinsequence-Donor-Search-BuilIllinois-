## Problem Statement
I am working on facilitating matchmaking between students and donors. the reason why this is convulated is beacuse the data for the lives in different datatables and microservices. additionally, we are using database querying as opposed to using a third party search engine like sonar. so in this hackathon i focused on that capability. lets take an example of women in stem from teh chicago area. here when i search i should be able to see the relevant students show up. this might seem trivial but this feature is very powerful to faciliate our match making and beacuse of the multiple streams of data were using this makes it a hard feature to submit
